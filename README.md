# Vite Module Federation POC (Web)

A proof of concept of a toast manager made with React.js and TypeScript.

## Technologies

These are some of the tecnologies used in this project:

- `jotai`: A lightweight, flexible state management library for React, offering a simple API similar to React's built-in `useState` but with scalable atomic state and efficient re-renders.
- `react`: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components.
- `typescript`: A superset of JavaScript that introduces optional static typing, interfaces, enums, and other language features.
- `vite`:  A blazing-fast frontend build tool with instant server start, ES modules support, and built-in Module Federation support (via plugins) for micro-frontends and dynamic code sharing across apps.

_For more information about other dependencies, see the `package.json` file._
